// Attach certain variables to the StartStuffOff context. First we've got [account(init, payer = user, space = 9000)]. All we're doing here is telling Solana how we want to initialize BaseAccount.
// We then have pub user: Signer<'info> which is data passed into the program that proves to the program that the user calling this program actually owns their wallet account.
// Finally, we have pub system_program: Program which is actually pretty freaking cool. It's basically a reference to the SystemProgram. The SystemProgram is the program that basically runs Solana. It is responsible for a lot of stuff, but one of the main things it does is create accounts on Solana. The SystemProgram is a program the creators of Solana deployed that other programs like ours talk to haha â€” it has an id of 11111111111111111111111111111111.
